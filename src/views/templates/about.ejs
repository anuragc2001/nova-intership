                <h3 id="s1head">About Us</h3>
                <p id="one">Amar Wood Industries Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad is the pioneer in manufacture of Stainless Steel Water Tanks (304/316 grade). We manufacture Water Tanks from sizes 30 to 8000 litres using Seam Welding Technology which incorporates fusion of two metals without the use of any foreign filler material thus ensuring rust proof welding for lifetime.</p>
                <p id="two">Unlike plastic tanks where the bottom surface is flat and very difficult to clean, as there is no drain out for the water to be flushed out, these SS Water Tanks are provided with a dish shaped Bottom.</p>
                <p id="three">This unique dish shaped design provided at the bottom ensures that the water is never stagnant and all the sedimentary particles in water settle down at the bottom by gravity, thus ensuring that the SS Water Tanks can be cleaned daily with ease just by opening a tap/valve which can be provided at the bottom (for complete DRAIN out purpose). This minimizes water borne diseases which is the main cause of worry in plastic tanks where water is predominantly stagnant (due to the flat bottom) and fungus/bacteria prone.</p>
                <p id="four">These Water Tanks are microbiologically 100% safe as they are made from food grade material SS 304/316.</p>

                <h3 id="s2head">Installation</h3>
                <p id="five">Unlike Plastic tanks which require a cement flat base or bed to be prepared for its installation, SS Water Tanks come with Inbuilt Stand on which the Water Tanks is mounted. This arrangement can be easily shifted wherever and whenever we wish too.</p>
                <p id="six">The connecting pipes can be directly fitted to the checknuts available at four locations.</p>
                <p id="seven">This unique dish shaped design provided at the bottom ensures that the water is never stagnant and all the sedimentary particles in water settle down at the bottom by gravity, thus ensuring that the SS Water Tanks can be cleaned daily with ease just by opening a tap/valve which can be provided at the bottom (for complete DRAIN out purpose).

                <p id="eight">The connecting pipes can be directly fitted to the tank nipples available at Four locations - Inlet Hole , Overflow Hole at the Top of the Tank and Outlet Hole, Drain Hole at the Bottom of the Tank</p>

                <p>80% diseases are due to water contamination /sub standard quality of water and the same percentage of deaths is due to water borne diseases!! According to UNICEF unsafe drinking water, inadequate availability of water for hygiene and unhygienic storage of water contribute to 88 percent of deaths pertaining to Water Borne Diseases .</p>
